## How to Use

### 1. Automatic Detection
When you upload marketing data, the domain analyzer will:
1. Detect marketing column patterns
2. Score the dataset for marketing domain fit
3. Suggest relevant marketing components
4. Provide domain-specific recommendations

### 2. Manual Component Selection
You can manually select marketing components from the "Marketing Analysis" category:
1. Browse available components
2. Check compatibility with your dataset
3. Select relevant analyses
4. Configure column mappings if needed

### 3. Column Mapping Interface
For marketing components that support column selection:
```python
# Example column mapping for Campaign Metrics Analysis
selected_columns = {
    'impressions': 'your_impressions_column',
    'clicks': 'your_clicks_column', 
    'conversions': 'your_conversions_column',
    'spend': 'your_cost_column',
    'revenue': 'your_revenue_column',
    'campaign': 'your_campaign_name_column'
}
```

## Data Quality Recommendations

### Marketing Data Best Practices
1. **Consistent naming:** Use clear column names (impressions, clicks, conversions)
2. **Complete data:** Ensure all related metrics are present
3. **Data types:** Numeric for metrics, categorical for dimensions
4. **Time series:** Include date/timestamp for trend analysis
5. **Logical consistency:** Ensure clicks ≤ impressions, etc.

### Common Issues Detected
- **Logical inconsistencies:** More clicks than impressions
- **Missing values:** High missing rates in key metrics
- **Negative values:** Negative spend or impression values
- **Zero inflation:** Too many zero values in key metrics
