# Real-Time Monitoring Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive real-time monitoring for users in the custom analysis workspace, providing clear visibility into resource usage, rate limits, and system status.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting System
- **File**: `core/eda/security/rate_limiter.py`
- **Features**: Per-user rate and concurrent execution limits
- **Limits**: 15 executions per minute, 3 concurrent executions per user
- **Tracking**: Real-time tracking of user execution counts and active processes

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring Widget
- **File**: `static/js/eda/rate-limit-monitor.js`
- **Features**: 
  - Real-time display of execution limits (current/max)
  - Progress bars showing usage percentages
  - System status (memory, CPU, active users)
  - Session duration tracking
  - Expandable detailed view
  - Color-coded status indicators

### 3. Backend API Endpoints
- **File**: `core/eda/advanced_eda/routes.py`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/api/rate-limit-status` - Current user's rate limit status
  - `/api/system-stats` - Server system statistics
- **Updates**: Real-time data refreshed every 15 seconds

### 4. UI Integration
- **Custom Analysis Tab**: `templates/eda/custom_analysis_tab.html`
  - Monitor widget appears after examples panel
  - Integrates with existing code execution flow
  - Shows real-time feedback during code execution

> **Note:** The dedicated LLM tab has been retired; monitoring now focuses solely on the custom analysis experience.

### 5. Security Enhancements
- **File**: `core/eda/security/simplified_sandbox.py`
- **Features**:
  - Secure code execution environment
  - User-specific temp directories
  - Resource monitoring and limits
  - Dataset access restrictions

## Visual Features

### Summary View (Always Visible)
- **Executions/Min**: Shows current usage vs. limit (e.g., "3/15")
- **Concurrent Processes**: Active executions vs. limit (e.g., "1/3")
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of usage percentage
- **Status Badge**: Color-coded status (Available, High Usage, Limited)

### Detailed View (Expandable)
- **Usage Statistics**:
  - Remaining executions in current minute
  - Active processes count
  - Session duration timer
- **System Status**:
  - Server memory usage percentage
  - Server CPU usage percentage  
  - Number of active users
- **Resource Limits**:
  - Memory limit per execution (512 MB)
  - CPU limit per execution (50%)
  - Execution timeout (30 seconds)

## Status Indicators

### Color-Coded System
- **Green (Available)**: < 60% usage, executions available
- **Yellow (High Usage)**: 60-80% usage, approaching limits
- **Red (Limited)**: > 80% usage or at concurrent limit

### Real-Time Updates
- Monitors update every 15 seconds automatically
- Immediate feedback during code execution
- Live tracking of execution start/end events

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users see exactly how many executions they have remaining
2. **Planning**: Users can plan their analysis based on available resources  
3. **Feedback**: Clear visual indicators when approaching or hitting limits
4. **Guidance**: Actionable information about when they can execute more code
5. **System Awareness**: Understanding of server load and system health

## Technical Features

1. **Robust Initialization**: Multiple fallback strategies to ensure monitor displays
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if backend is unavailable
3. **Performance**: Lightweight updates every 15 seconds
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing custom analysis flow
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly Bootstrap-based interface

## Next Steps

The monitoring system is now fully implemented and integrated. Users will see:
- Real-time resource usage in the custom analysis tab
- Clear feedback about execution limits and system status
- Visual progress bars and status indicators
- Detailed system information when needed

The system provides the transparency and control needed for a multi-user EDA environment while maintaining security and resource management.
